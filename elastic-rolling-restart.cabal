synopsis:           Tool to perform rolling-restarts on Elasticsearch clusters
description:
  A complete Elasticsearch cluster restart may be required in various cases.
  Some of the most common cases are upgrading the Elasticsearch version of the
  cluster, or performing maintenance tasks to the elasticsearch servers itself
  (such as hardware, or OS related tasks), Also, for elasticsearch setups that
  are based on custom plugins to enhance their core functionality, such as
  analyzers, custom scripts, etc, a full cluster restart may be required even
  for a single plugin update.
  .
  Performing such tasks often, and for many different clusters can become quite
  a pain in the administrator's day-to-day operations. The current tool aims to
  automate the task of performing a rolling cluster restart, by allowing a
  whole Elasticsearch cluster to be restarted - keeping it online and
  operational with no downtime for end users, by taking nodes offline one a
  time. It implements the common elasticsearch `Rolling Restart`_ algorithm.
  .
